# ðŸ“Š  Power BI Analytics Dashboards

##  Project Overview
This repository showcases a suite of **interactive Power BI dashboards** developed during my internship at **Welspun Group**. The dashboards are designed for **enterprise-level user activity monitoring**, **license utilization analysis**, and **departmental engagement insights** across multiple business units.

The data was sourced from internal user activity logs and system usage reports, and was transformed using **Power Query** and modeled with **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**.

#### Description:
This dashboard provides a **macro-level overview** of user activity and licensing statistics across business units and departments.

#### Key Features:
- **New Users by Month**: Bar chart visualizing user onboarding trends over time.
- **Average Activities by Department**: Departmental breakdown of usage volume using clustered bar visuals.
- **Active vs. Inactive Users**: Segmentation by status and company (WELSPUN India, Global, UK, USA).
- **User Activity Metrics (KPI Tiles)**:
  - `New Users MTD`
  - `New Users LMTD`
  - `Total Active Users`
  - `Inactive Users`
  - `Licensed Users`

#### Technical Highlights:
- **Slicer filters** for Company, Department, and Date Range.
- Use of **DAX measures** to calculate MTD/LMTD user counts.
- Visuals built using **stacked bar charts**, **table visuals**, and **KPI indicators**.

###  2. Individual User Activity Tracker

#### Description:
This dashboard provides a **micro-level deep dive** into individual user behavior within the enterprise applications.

#### Key Features:
- **Total Activities & Events**: Quantitative metrics representing user interaction frequency.
- **User Profile Metadata**: Department, role, office location, and license status.
- **User Event Trend (Time Series)**: Line chart tracking activity timeline (CreationDate).
- **Weekly Event Distribution**: Column chart for day-wise activity.
- **Activity Type Ratio**: Pie chart visualizing the distribution of activity types:
  - `ViewReport`, `ExportReport`, `InstallApp`, `CreateReport`, `RefreshDataset`, etc.

#### Technical Highlights:
- Use of **time intelligence DAX functions** to generate weekly trends.
- Integration of **user metadata** with activity metrics.
- **Hierarchical filters** for year selection and user name.
